### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Legnine and I am a Roblox game Dev.
### I just got bored and partially moved to Github
###
### I have a GBA emulator: https://legnine.github.io/GBA-emulator
### Credits go to Cattn for that one. (I wanted to know how cloning worked)
### You have to import the ROMS directly.
### You have to go to https://github.com/JWsley/Roms to download the ROMS
### Thats it for now...
